> 🦀 Documenting my journey from self-taught beginner to influential Rust developer

## 🎯 The Mission

To become a great, influential Rust developer by:
- Learning in public
- Contributing to open source
- Building real projects
- Helping others along the way

**Why public?** Because accountability breeds consistency, and transparency helps others following the same path.

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

> "The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried."

**My Principles:**

1. **Consistency over intensity** - Daily practice beats weekend marathons
2. **Public learning** - Share struggles and victories openly
3. **Help while learning** - Teaching solidifies understanding
4. **Patience with myself** - Growth takes time
5. **Community first** - Programming is collaborative, not competitive

**What "great" means to me:**
- Not writing perfect code, but code that solves real problems
- Not knowing everything, but knowing how to learn anything
- Not working alone, but building with and for community
- Not just consuming open source, but contributing back

## 🤝 For Other Learners

If you're on a similar journey:

**You're not alone.** Learning Rust is hard. Systems programming is hard. Impostor syndrome is real.

**You can do this.** If I can, you can. We're all figuring this out together.

**Learn with me.** Open an issue, start a discussion, share your journey. Let's grow together.

**Resources that helped me:** See `/resources/README.md`

## 🦀 About Me

I'm a university student who taught myself Rust starting in August 2024. 

I decided I want to become a great, influential Rust developer. Not just someone who can code in Rust, but someone who contributes meaningfully to the ecosystem and helps others.

I've been:
- Coding in Rust daily since August
- Attending Rust Lang meetings for 3+ weeks
- Observing, learning, preparing

This repository is my public commitment to that journey.

**Connect with me:**
[Your GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, or however you want to connect]

# Day 1 - January 30, 2025

## 🎯 Today's Goal
Create the foundation for my public learning journey. Make it official.

---

## ✅ What I Did

### 1. Made It Official
- Created `rust-ascent` repository
- Wrote comprehensive README documenting my vision
- Committed to learning in public
- Set up tracking structure for the journey ahead

### 2. Prepared for First Contribution
- Researched Symposium project deeply
- Understood what it does and why it matters
- Read through documentation
- Drafted introduction message for Zulip
- Learned about MCP (Model Context Protocol)

### 3. Self-Reflection
- Asked myself the hard question: "Will I make it?"
- Got clear on what "great and influential" actually means
- Realized I'm already on the path, not waiting to start
- Documented my current status honestly

---

## 💡 What I Learned

### Technical
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** A way for LLMs to invoke custom tools
- **Symposium architecture:** Desktop app + VSCode extension + MCP server
- **Git worktrees:** Symposium uses these for taskspaces (isolated work environments)
- **Learning in public:** It's not just about showing success, it's about documenting the struggle

### About Myself
- I've been coding daily for 5+ months (August-January) - that's consistency
- I've been attending Rust Lang meetings for 3 weeks - that's community engagement
- I have a vision of becoming influential - that's purpose
- I'm willing to be public about my journey - that's courage

### About Open Source
- Start with documentation fixes (low stakes, high value)
- Observe project culture before diving in
- The first PR is about learning the process, not changing the world
- Every major contributor started with a first nervous PR

---

## 🤔 Challenges & Struggles

### Mental Blocks
- **Impostor syndrome:** "Am I good enough to contribute?"
  - *Reality check:* I don't need to be. Contributions at all levels are valued.
  
- **Perfectionism:** "My first contribution should be significant"
  - *Reality check:* My first contribution should be a learning experience. Start tiny.

- **Comparison:** "Others are so much further ahead"
  - *Reality check:* They started before me. I'm not behind; I'm on my own timeline.

### Technical Gaps
- Still not 100% comfortable with complex lifetime scenarios
- Haven't deeply explored async Rust yet
- MCP is completely new to me
- Need to understand how desktop apps interact with IDEs

**These aren't blockers. These are the things I'm here to learn.**

---

## 🎯 Tomorrow's Plan

1. **Post on Symposium Zulip** - Stop overthinking, just introduce myself
2. **Find one documentation issue** in Symposium - A typo, unclear sentence, anything
3. **Submit that first PR** - Make it tiny, make it today
4. **Write about the experience** - Document what I learned from the process
5. **Code daily practice** - Continue whatever project I'm working on

## 💭 Reflections

### The Moment Everything Changed

Today I decided to stop preparing and start doing. 

For weeks I've been "getting ready" - reading docs, attending meetings, watching from the sidelines. Today I realized: **the best preparation is participation.**

I'm not going to be ready. I'm never going to feel ready. The feeling of readiness comes AFTER you do the thing, not before.

### What "Great" Actually Means

I've been thinking about my goal - "great, influential Rust developer."

I realized it's not about:
- Writing the most clever code
- Having the most GitHub stars
- Being the smartest person in the room
- Knowing everything about Rust

It's about:
- Solving real problems
- Helping real people
- Building things that matter
- Growing consistently
- Lifting others as I climb

**That version of "great" is achievable. It's already happening.**

### The Power of Day 1

There's something powerful about declaring "Day 1."

Not "I've been learning for 5 months" (which is true).
But "Today is Day 1 of learning in public."

It's a reset. A fresh start. A line in the sand that says: "Everything before was practice. Now it counts."

**From today forward, every day counts.**

---

## 📊 Metrics

- **Lines of Rust written today:** [Whatever I did in daily practice]
- **Open source contributions:** 0 (but not for long!)
- **Zulip post:** Drafted, not sent yet
- **People helped:** 0 (but I'm going to start)
- **Days in a row coding:** 150+ (Aug-Jan)
- **Confidence level:** 7/10 (better than yesterday)

---

## 🔥 Motivation

### Quote of the Day
> "A journey of a thousand commits begins with a single git init"

### Why I'm Doing This

When I look back in 5 years at the "great, influential Rust developer" I'll have become, I want to see this moment documented.

I want to remember:
- The nervousness of starting
- The uncertainty about whether I'd make it
- The decision to go public despite the fear
- The commitment to show up every single day

**This is where legends begin.**

Not with confidence. Not with skill. Not with readiness.

With a decision. And then another decision tomorrow. And the next day.

**Day 1. Let's climb.** 🦀⛰️

---

## ✨ Win of the Day

**I created this repository.**

That might not sound like much, but it's everything. It's the difference between "thinking about learning" and "actively learning in public."

It's commitment. It's courage. It's the first step.

**And the first step is always the hardest.**

## 📝 Notes to Future Me

Hey future me,

If you're reading this from Day 100, or Day 365, or Day 1000:

Remember this feeling. The mix of excitement and fear. The decision to start before feeling ready. The commitment to do this in public.

Remember that on Day 1, you didn't know if you'd make it. You just decided to show up.

**That decision led to wherever you are now.**

Keep going. Keep climbing. Keep learning.

And don't forget to help someone else having their Day 1.

You were that person once.

— Past You, Day 1

*Tomorrow I make my first contribution. Tomorrow the real work begins.*

*But today? Today I showed up. And that's enough.* ✨

**Status:** ✅ Day 1 Complete

**Commitment:** Unshaken 🔥

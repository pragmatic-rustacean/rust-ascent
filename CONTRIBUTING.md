# Contributing to rust-ascent

## This is a Learning Journey

This repository documents my personal journey learning Rust.
While contributions are welcome, please understand this is 
primarily a learning log, not a collaborative project.

## How You Can Help

- **Share your journey:** Fork this repo structure for your own journey
- **Suggest resources:** Open an issue with helpful resources
- **Fix typos:** PRs welcome for typos/broken links
- **Encourage:** Leaving supportive comments is always welcome

## What Not to Do

- Don't rewrite my learning notes (they're meant to be in my voice)
- Don't "correct" my daily logs (they're reflections, not docs)
- Don't expect this to be professionally maintained

## Questions?

Open an issue! I'm happy to discuss Rust, learning strategies, 
or help others starting their journey.
